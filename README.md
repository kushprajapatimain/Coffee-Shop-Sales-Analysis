## 🔎 Overview

This project represents an end-to-end sales analysis workflow using **Microsoft Excel**. It includes data cleaning, transformation, KPI computation, and dashboard design. The resulting interactive dashboard enables quick insights into sales patterns across time, location, and category — empowering business optimization through data visualization and analysis.

## 🛑 Problem Statement

The Coffee Shop management lacked visibility into key sales metrics, customer patterns, and store-wise performance. The following challenges were identified:

* Unclear which **products or categories** generate the most revenue.
* Limited understanding of **footfall patterns** and **store location performance**.

This project solves these issues by developing an interactive dashboard with dynamic slicers, charts, and KPIs to highlight business performance in a clear, actionable format.
